What is the advantage and disadvantage of BinarySearchTree over HashTable data struc-tures?

Hash tables, when it comes to time complexity, mostly takes less time than Binary Search Trees.

One advantage Binary Search Trees have over Hash Tables, however, is that Binary Search Trees have an order,
making it easier to access specific information. Also, Binary Search Trees compared to Hashtables, are more
customizable.
