Advantages and Disadvantages of Hash Tables over Array Lists and Linked Lists

For adding, finding, and removing elements, CHTs have O(thash(Key)) time which is similar to O(1) time
 while for ArrayLists adding, deleting, and finding elements runs at O(n) time, while Linked Lists run O(n) on
find but O(1) for adding and removing, making CHT almost more advantageous at adding, finding, and removing 
elements than both arraylists and linked lists. The reason I state almost though, is because the time complexity
is still somewhat dependent on the hash function, and depending on the complexity of the hash, the time could
change.
